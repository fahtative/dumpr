Dumpr is a Clojure library for live replicating data from a MySQL
database. It allows you to programmatically tap into the MySQL binary
log. This is the mechanism that MySQL uses to replicate data from
master to slaves. This library is based on the wonderful
[MySQL Binary Log connector](https://github.com/shyiko/mysql-binlog-connector-java)
project. It adds a higher level data format for content consumption
and a robust stream abstraction to replace callback based interface.

Dumpr targets MySQL version 5.7.x and 8.0.x. It might work against other
versions of MySQL as well, but that's not guaranteed.

Some potential use cases for this library are:

* populating a search index live without needing to constantly run
  (potentially expensive) queries against MySQL
* building live views of data for caching or analytics
* building a change data capture system by streaming data into Kafka
  streams, à la
  [bottledwater-pg](https://github.com/confluentinc/bottledwater-pg).

Data is made available as a stream of upserts and
deletes of table rows. These streams are exposed as
[Manifold](https://github.com/ztellman/manifold) sources which can be
consumed directly or easily coerced into core.async channels et al.

The API consists of two main operations, initial table load and
starting a live streaming from a given binary log position. Both
operations expose the same data abstraction, an ordered stream of
upserts and deletes (described in more detail below).

This library is work in progress and might have bugs. All interfaces
must be considered subject to change.

Make sure your MySQL server is using UTC.

## Installation

With Leiningen/Boot:

```clojure
[org.sharetribe/dumpr "0.2.2"]
```

### Initial load

In order to replicate a data set from MySQL we start by loading the
contents of desired tables.

```clojure
> (require '[dumpr.core :as dumpr])
nil

;; Create dumpr configuration. See docstring for other options.
> (def conf (dumpr/create-conf {:user "user"
                                :password "password"
                                :host "127.0.0.1"
                                :port 3306
                                :db "database_name"
                                :server-id 111}))
#'user/conf

;; Create a table load stream. Tables are loaded and contents returned
;; in given order.
> (def table-stream (dumpr/create-table-stream conf [:people :addresses]))
#'user/table-stream

;; Grab the Manifold source that will receive the results.
> (def source (dumpr/source table-stream))
#'user/source

;; Starts the table load operation. Have source consumer setup before
;; calling this to avoid unnecessary backpressure.
> (dumpr/start-stream! table-stream)
true
```

### Binary log streaming

Binary log streaming is started from the supplied binary log
position. A binary log position can be grabbed from the table load
stream to continue streaming new updates that happen after the initial
load operation. Normally you would then persist the binary log
position from the stream contents as you consume updates and use that
latest position to restart streaming if/when process restarts. A
stored position can be validated against the source database to make
sure it's still available. Binary log retention policy for MySQL is
configurable. You should set this to allow some margin for downtime in
replicating process.

```clojure
;; Grab the binary log position. It's a plain clojure map.
> (def binlog-pos (dumpr/next-position table-stream))
#'user/binlog-pos
> binlog-pos
{:file "host-bin.000001", :position 1259353}

;; Log position can be validated
> (dumpr/valid-binlog-pos? conf binlog-pos)
true

;; Create a stream using previous position
> (def binlog-stream (dumpr/create-binlog-stream conf binlog-pos))
#'user/binlog-stream
> (def source (dumpr/source binlog-stream))
#'user/source
> (dumpr/start-stream! binlog-stream)
true

;; Unlike table stream binlog stream can be closed as part of clean
;; shutdown.
(dumpr/stop-stream! binlog-stream)
true
```

### Row format

The output of both stream operations is a stream of upserts and
deletes of database table rows. The rows are represented as tuples
(vectors): `[op-type table id content metadata]`.

| Field       | Description |
--------------|-------------|
| **op-type** | `:upsert` or `:delete` |
| **table**   | The database table of the row as keyword, example :people |
| **id**      | Id of the row. By default this is the value of row primary key. The default can be overridden by passing per table id functions via dumpr/create-conf. See docstring for full explanation. |
| **content** | The full content of the row as a clojure map that is inserted or updated after the operation, or that was just deleted in case of delete |
| **metadata** | Only used by binlog stream (`nil` for table stream rows). This is a map like: `{:ts #inst "2015-08-03T10:32:53.000-00:00" :next-position 123 :next-file "host-bin.00001"}`. The ts is a timestamp from MySQL when the binlog event was created. The next-filename and next-position are the binlog position for continuing streaming after this row. |

These tuples are fairly convenient to consume either using vector
destructuring or then using the
[core.match](https://github.com/clojure/core.match) library.

### Using a Database Connection Pool

When creating the dumpr configuration you can optionally pass in your
own db-spec. When present, dumpr skips constructing it's own
db-spec. This db-spec is passed through as is to all queries via
[clojure.java.jdbc](https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc). If you
handle creating db-spec yourself you must ensure you include these two
properties to MySQL Connector/J:

* zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull
* tinyInt1isBit=false

These ensure that both batch loading and streaming return exactly the
same data in the same row format. This is the fundamental guarantee
about data shape that the Dumpr abstraction aims to keep.

For more information about clojure.java.jdbc connection pooling see:
[http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/java_jdbc/connection_pooling.html](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/java_jdbc/connection_pooling.html).

## Development

Testing and development require a working MySQL instance that is setup
for replication. This requires that you enable binlog and specify a
server id. Binlog format has to be set to ROW for streaming to
work. For example:

```bash
$ mysqld --log-bin --server-id=5 --binlog_format=ROW
```

The server-id has to be something other than what the test/dev clients use. By
default tests use server-id `123`.

### Dev environment

For development purposes the dev code includes a
[Component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) based
system. The configuration for which server and database to connect
must be defined in config/dumpr-dev-configuration.edn. You can create
your own setup by copying the default configuration,
[config/dumpr-lib-configuration.edn](config/dumpr-lib-configuration.edn) and overriding the keys you want to
change.

When the configuration is in order you can start the dev system by running `(reset)` in user namespace.

### Running tests locally

Tests need a test database to use. By default this database is
`dumpr_test_db_123`. Create a test db and user:

```bash
$ mysql -u root
mysql> create database dumpr_test_db_123;
mysql> grant all privileges on dumpr_test_db_123.* to 'dumpr_test'@'localhost' identified by 'dumpr_test';
mysql> grant replication client on *.* to 'dumpr_test'@'localhost';
mysql> grant replication slave on *.* to 'dumpr_test'@'localhost';
```

You can also do this by running the included script:

```bash
mysql -u root < setup_test_db.sql
```

These default settings are stored in
[config/dumpr-lib-configuration.edn](config/dumpr-lib-configuration.edn). If you wish to use different
database connection parameters, test database name or database user
you can override any of the default settings by creating a
config/dumpr-test-configuration.edn and defining the configurations
you wish to override there.

Finally, run the tests with: `lein test`

## Ideas

* Heartbeat event for slowly updating (or heavily filtered) sources to keep binlog position fresh.
* DDL parsing to replace the naive table schema cache. This would allow processing and reprocessing events from the past after table schema changes.
* Change (undocumented) error events to exceptions and document the behavior.

## Known issues

* The next binlog position returned in events may not be usable when single SQL
  query caused large number of rows to change. This can manifest itself in the
  rare event when a consumer crashes during processing of the set of events
  corresponding to the single query.
